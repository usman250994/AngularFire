# AngularFire
Front end with angularjs 1 and  and firebase as NOSQL database.


In my FYP we were working on a research paper where we were to control and create an aviation system for UNmanned Aircarafts (drones) 
We got the coordinates using GPS and now wehen it comes to display it on amap/graph for visual representation. i tried creating an illustration using angular.js . this was my first experience towards angularjs and I just have uploaded a small small piece of my work.  

This is an icomplete part of my code just for the purpose of referece to my research work.
